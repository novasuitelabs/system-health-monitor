## üîç **How to Verify Signatures**

### **For Users:**
Users can verify the authenticity of your releases using Cosign:

```bash
# Verify the installer
cosign verify-blob --certificate-identity-regexp ".*" --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp ".*" "System Health Monitor Setup 1.0.0.exe"

# Verify the executable
cosign verify-blob --certificate-identity-regexp ".*" --certificate-oidc-issuer-regexp ".*" "System Health Monitor.exe"
```

### **For Developers:**
You can verify your own signatures:

```bash
npm run verify-signatures
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Benefits**

### **1. Windows SmartScreen Protection**
- **Reduces Warning Frequency**: Signed executables are less likely to trigger SmartScreen warnings
- **Builds Reputation**: Consistent signing helps build Windows Defender reputation
- **User Trust**: Users see fewer scary warning dialogs

### **2. Transparency & Verification**
- **Public Ledger**: All signatures are recorded in public Rekor transparency log
- **Immutable Records**: Signatures cannot be tampered with or removed
- **Open Source**: Users can verify the signing process and authenticity

### **3. Supply Chain Security**
- **Identity Verification**: Signing tied to your authenticated identity
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of when and by whom files were signed
- **Compromise Detection**: Any tampering invalidates signatures

## üì¶ **For GitHub Releases**

When creating your GitHub release, include these files:

### **Required Files:**
1. `System Health Monitor Setup 1.0.0.exe` (Installer)
2. `System Health Monitor Setup 1.0.0.exe.blockmap` (Update file)
3. `latest.yml` (Auto-updater config)
4. `System Health Monitor v1.0.0 Portable.zip` (Portable version)

### **Signature Information:**
- **Signatures are stored in Rekor transparency log**
- **No separate .sig files needed for distribution**
- **Users verify directly against the transparency log**

## üîÑ **Future Builds**

### **Automatic Signing:**
Future builds will automatically sign when you run:
```bash
npm run dist
```

The `afterSign` hook will:
1. Detect Windows builds
2. Automatically sign executables with Cosign
3. Continue build process seamlessly

### **Manual Signing:**
If you need to sign existing files:
```bash
npm run sign-release
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

### **1. OIDC Authentication Required**
- Signing requires browser authentication
- Uses your GitHub/Google/Microsoft identity
- Identity is recorded in certificate

### **2. Public Transparency**
- All signatures are public in Rekor
- Your email/identity is recorded
- Cannot be removed once signed

### **3. SmartScreen Improvement Timeline**
- **Immediate**: Some reduction in warnings
- **Short-term (days)**: Windows builds reputation for your certificates
- **Long-term (weeks)**: Significant reduction in SmartScreen warnings

## üìû **Support & Verification**

### **Verify Your Signatures:**
